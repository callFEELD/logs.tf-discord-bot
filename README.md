An official bot is under development right now. If you want to take part of beta [contact me](https://steamcommunity.com/id/callFEELD). During the beta phase be warned that the bot could be offline for troubleshooting for a few minutes. Also data can be lost during processes.

### manual installing guide:
1. install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip

Note For POSIX users (including Mac OS X and Linux users), the examples in this guide assume the use of a virtual environment.
For Windows users, the examples in this guide assume that the option to adjust the system PATH environment variable was selected when installing Python.

2. go to your CMD and type "python3 -m pip install discord.py" and after that "python3 -m pip install asyncio"

3. download this code

4. insert the code into your python3 folder

5. Create a Discord Bot (tutorial: https://github.com/callFEELD/logs.tf-discord-bot/wiki/Create-a-DiscordBOT) and let the bot join your server (tutorial: https://github.com/callFEELD/logs.tf-discord-bot/wiki/Let-the-Discord-Bot-join-your-server)

6. fill the token inside the token.json file (tutorial: https://github.com/callFEELD/logs.tf-discord-bot/wiki/insert-the-token-to-the-token.json-file)

7. get your Discord ID (enable the developer mode in discord (Settings -> Appearance; scroll down and check "Developer Mode") after that you can rightclick on your profile in a server member list and hit "copy id") and SteamID64 and fill them into the users.json file inside the moderators object. (tutorial: https://github.com/callFEELD/logs.tf-discord-bot/wiki/insert-your-Discord-ID-and-Steam-ID-into-the-users.json-file)

8. run the python script "bot.py" with "python3 bot.py"
